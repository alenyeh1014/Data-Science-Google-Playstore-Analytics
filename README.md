# Market Analytics: Google Playstore Preference 
Hi all, this is a Data Analytics Project ! - Market Analytics with Machine Learning methodologies.


### Project Objective

* The purpose of this project is to make Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply Machine Learning Methodology for Market Analytics. At the same time, we are trying to uncover the critical factors for user preferences of Google PlayStore.


### Methods Used

* Inferential Statistics
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Sentiment Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling


### Algorithm Used

- Machine Learning: 
  - Linear Regression (LR)
  - Random Forest Regression (RFR)
  - Random Forest Classification (RFC)


### Technologies and Packaged Used

* Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau
* Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels.api
* Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


### Project Description

* Motivation:

  - Since Google Playstore is becoming bigger and competitive, the number of applications available in the Google Playstore has increased dramatically. Therefore, in order to seize this great business opportunity, more and more people are trying to figure out which factors are critical to the users.  
  
  
* Data and Scope:

  - The dataset is downloaded from kaggle and it is also a open competition for all people who are interested in. The data size is around 10000 with some missing valuse insides, so still need to clean it before data analytics.
  
  
* Methodology Approach:

  - Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. The convolution emulates the response of an individual neuron to visual stimuli. Each neuron processes data only for itsÂ receptive field.

  
* Conclusion:
