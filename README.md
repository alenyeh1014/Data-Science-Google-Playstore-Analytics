* Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


### Project Description

* Motivation:

  - Since Google Playstore is becoming larger and more competitive, the number of applications available in the Google Playstore has increased dramatically. Therefore, in order to seize this great business opportunity, more and more developers are trying to figure out which factors are critical to the users.  
  
  
* Data and Scope:

  - The dataset is downloaded from kaggle. It is an open competition for participants who are willing to work on this project. The data size is around 10000 with meaningless and missing values. Thus, data cleansing is the first and the most important step to overcome in order to truly understand the importance weights for each variable.
